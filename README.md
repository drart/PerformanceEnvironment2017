Performance Environment 2017
============================

This is a Flocking.js project to collect my synths, mappings, and other ideas together in one place. The idea is to have it all ready to go in both a browser and node.js scenario. 

- index.html: browser based hub (still working on a websockets solution)
- server.js: node.js web and osc server
- pressuresynth.html: playing with pressure.js for 3D Touch and Apple Pencil
- applepenciloscsender.html: pencil to OSC sender
- pressureoscsender.html: sends pressure.js mouse, touch, and pointer via OSC
- tests: a number of proof of concept tools that are useful for me (maybe you too)

Stuff to do
- Sounds to buses for mixing in the analog world. 
- Create a number of sounds for the available number of analog channels. 
- https://dzone.com/articles/exploring-html5-web-audio
- Add in a digital mixer compatibility
- Add in a drum interface
- add an iMS-20 mapping
- ugen.scope for monitoring output
